## CRITICAL IMPLEMENTATION NOTES

✓ **Minimal Images:** Use emoji/SVG icons only (📞 ✉️ 💬 🏠 🎓 🔑 etc). Optionally add CEO photo as small circle (200x200px max) in hero. NO property photos.

✓ **Text-Heavy Design:** Typography and whitespace are the visual elements. Large, bold headings guide attention.

✓ **Glassmorphism:** Service cards use `backdrop-filter: blur(10px)` with semi-transparent white + gold border

✓ **GSAP Library:** Load from CDN (https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/gsap/3.12.2/)

✓ **Fonts:** Load from Google Fonts (Playfair Display, Inter)

✓ **Smooth Scroll:** All navigation links use GSAP smooth scroll (1s duration)

✓ **Sticky Header:** Fixed position, z-index 1000, white background, navy text, gold hover

✓ **Accessibility:** Color contrast 4.5:1, keyboard navigation, focus indicators, respects prefers-reduced-motion
